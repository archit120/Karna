### Title

Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection

### tl;dr

The paper first investigates why one-stage object detection networks trail in accuracy compared to two-stage models and then proposes a new loss function to improve upon the shortcomings.

### Describe the method

> Describe the architecture used, description of data, results achieved, reasons metioned in the paper

### Any further details

> Further references

### My two cents

> Anything constructive you make from the paper or which 'tweak of architecture" do you propose or a transfer learning solution or anythin' weird
